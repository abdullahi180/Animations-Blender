# Animations-Blender

This project combines techniques taught in labs as well as techniques learned through online resources. 
The aim of this project was to model and animate an object that may exists in 2050. The scene/ animation I developed is the discovery of a new planet not yet known to humans today. It includes a rocket flying past, and a spaceship which can transform into a beaming moon. In the scene there are several ufoâ€™s scattered around, these represent unknown robotic systems that are discovered on this planet.
Thunder effects are added to illustrate the power that the metallic/ robot dragon possesses. Spaceships can mould and transform into other objects. This scene is planet x 2050.
